# Application Name: Tweak

## Idea

Tweak is a website for creative users to upload their DIY life hacks.

## Motivation

Tweak is great for people who enjoy creating small but fun projects 
and sharing their ideas to the world. The website is also great for
people who wish to find new life hacks to create shortcuts and improve
productivity without cost. The tools to create your own DIY life hacks
can be found in your home.

I want to build this website because I believe people shouldn’t have to 
spend money to buy unnecessary commercial gadgets when costless alternatives 
exist. For example, most home should have one bottle of ketchup; the user
can pour mixed pancake batter into an empty ketchup bottle to create fun
pancake art and avoid the messy experience. The users can reuse simple tools 
in their home to hack their way through life.
